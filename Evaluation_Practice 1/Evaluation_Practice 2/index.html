                <p>
                    CSS transitions provide a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties. 
                    Instead of having property changes take effect immediately, 
                    you can cause the changes in a property to take place over a period of time. For example, 
                    if you change the color of an element from white to black, usually the change is instantaneous.
                    With CSS transitions enabled,
                    changes occur at time intervals that follow an acceleration curve, all of which can be customized.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Animations that involve transitioning between two states are often called implicit transitions 
                    as the states in between the start and final states are implicitly defined by the browser.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CSS transitions let you decide which properties to animate (by listing them explicitly), 
                    when the animation will start (by setting a delay), how long the transition will last (by setting a duration), 
                    and how the transition will run (by defining an easing function, e.g., linearly or quick at the beginning, slow at the end).

                <p>
                    The Web author can define which property has to be animated and in which way. 
                    This allows the creation of complex transitions. However, some properties are
                     not animatable as it doesn't make sense to animate them.

                <p>
                    Custom properties (sometimes referred to as CSS variables or cascading variables) are 
                    entities defined by CSS authors that represent specific values to be reused throughout a document.
                     They are set using the @property at-rule or by custom property syntax (e.g., --primary-color: blue;).
                      Custom properties are accessed using the CSS var() function (e.g., color: var(--primary-color);).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Complex websites have very large amounts of CSS, and this often results in a lot of repeated CSS values. For example,
                     it's common to see the same color used in hundreds of different places in stylesheets. Changing a color that's been 
                     duplicated in many places requires a search and replace across all rules and CSS files. Custom properties allow a 
                     value to be defined in one place, then referenced in multiple other places so that it's easier to work with. 
                     Another benefit is readability and semantics. For example, 
                    --main-text-color is easier to understand than the hexadecimal color #00ff00, 
                    especially if the color is used in different contexts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Custom properties defined using two dashes (--) are subject to the cascade and inherit their value from their parent. 
                    The @property at-rule allows more control over the custom property and lets you specify whether it inherits its value 
                    from a parent, what the initial value is, and the type constraints that should apply.
